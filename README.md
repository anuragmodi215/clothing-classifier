# clothing-classifier
#In this project I built a very basic Deep Neural Network which categorises items of clothing.I try to simplify the process as much as possible.I used Python along #with TensorFlow and Keras to build this neural network. The dataset used to train the model is the Fashion-MNIST dataset
